Mnemonic device generator

This was a project I was hoping my kids would work on, but alas they haven't.  
The idea is to be able to take a number of words, find alternative to those words and create a list of possible acronyms.
This project was an idea of my wife's when she was taking a neo-natal class.
The teacher had acronymns that were not spelled correctly and therefore were hard to recall what they stood for.
